# odin-stb

Bindings to some libraries from the popular `stb` single-header libraries


To use the bindings you need to first compile static libraries. First, go to the `src` directory, then in Windows call `build.bat`, and in Linux just call `make`.

An example of using `stb_truetype` is shown in the `test_truetype.odin` file.
